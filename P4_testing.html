<!-- Feedback Summary -->
<section>
	<h4>
		Feedback Summary
	</h4>
	<p>
		After reading though the responses from our usertest we found out that our user were very happy with the usefullness of the site. They did however have some problems with the search. They thougt that it was confusing that the search was on sites that the search did not work. And some of them tought that it was confusing that the pictures did not link. 
		<br>
		There where no new complaints about the "ease of use". We got a good score from the test. 
		Same for "ease of learning", and "satisfaction". Only bad score we got was from our users that uses a mac computer, they thought that the site was not pleasant to use.

<!-- Our response -->
<section>
	<h4>
		Our response to the feedback
	</h4>
	<p>
		We looked at the feedback we got from the users and changed realized that some of the users where testing an old version of the site. After finding our testsubjects again and showing them the improved site they were happy that we had thought of their complaints.

<!-- Self reflection -->
<section>
	<h4>
		Self reflection
	</h4>
	<p>
		Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to  flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
