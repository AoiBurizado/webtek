<!-- Testing Audience -->
<section>
	<h4>
		Tester Audience
	</h4>
	<p>
		A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% college students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges you can do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well.

<!-- Feedback Summary -->
<section>
	<h4>
		Feedback Summary
	</h4>
	<p>
		After reading though the responses from our usertest we found out that our user were very happy with the usefullness of the site. They did however have some problems with the search. They thought that it was confusing that the search was on sites that the search did not work. The search function used to be placed at the navigation bar as shown in P2-document design. On the pages it could not be used, we make the background field grey instead of the usual white. And some of them thought that it was confusing that the pictures did not link. 
		<br>
		There where no complaints about the "ease of use". We got a good score from the test. 
		Same for "ease of learning", and "satisfaction". Only bad score we got was from our users that uses a mac computer, they thought that the site was not pleasant to use. Most of our users used a windows computer with a chrome browser. 
	</p>
</section>

<!-- Our response -->
<section>
	<h4>
		Our response to the feedback
	</h4>
	<p>
		We looked at the feedback we got from the users and changed realized that some of the users where testing an old version of the site. We were not completely done with it, but decided it would be nice to get some user feedback in case there was any big misunderstandings in the layout. As mentioned in the "Feedback Summary" the users had some issues with the "Search"-function and the "imagelink". The Imagelink was really easy to fix. The "Search"-function however was a bit different. The "search" function are actually not a "search"-function, but more like a "filter"-function. It filters the reviews on the site it is on. To solve this userconfusion, we moved the location of the "search/filter"-bar to the right of the page title. Which means this "search/filter" will only be on the index.html, dating_sim.html, rpg.html and visual_novel.html.
		<br>
		After testing the site with both new and old testsubjects again and showing them the improved site they were happy that we had thought of their complaints even if we had planned on changing them at the beginning. 
		It seemed most of the testers, both live testers and "online" testers seemed to be happy with the design. They were also very excited about the konamicode which a lot found very creative.

	<h4>
		Self reflection

	<p>
		Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to  flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
