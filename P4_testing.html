		Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to  flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
