	<h4>Review</h4>
	<p>
	Yandere Simulator takes place in a small town in a town taken out of an anime. The whole place has no personality and seams to just be their as an excuse for you to murder people. If you go into any classrom you can't tell the difference bacause the whole school is made by usiing the Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V method. Lazy design. Even the underpants of the female students seeams to be the same just in different colors. 
	<br>
	<br>
	You can also travel though the city to get to the school. There is no reason because you can just teleport to it from your bedroom, but it is made. And I am glad that it is optional. Trying to get to the school was a pain in the butt. It was so badly made that even the developers knows it. You get a popup when you start the level that "If you get stuck, click the space bar". The fact that they implementet such a bad feautre in the game, and don't fixx it before shipping makes me mad. It makes me concerned that they have done the same with other features in the game.

	The story of the game is wierd and disturbing. You are a meme. You are a kohai. A kohai is someone that is under a senpai. Senpai is like a mentor. And the game revolves around the "Notice me Senpai"-meme. 
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	You are in love with your senpai, but there is someone in your school that likes your senpai too. You need to kill this person bacause your senpai is just your senpai. To find out who this person is you need to take pictures of the underpants that the girls in your school are wearing. You send this to someone that knows everything. Someone that is kind of an oracle. By being smart and listening to other people talk, and to befriend everyone you can get the information you need to get to your rival. And kill your rival. 
	<br>

	<br>
	The feautures of the game are bad. They duck sick. You have this character three that you can use to level up different stuff, but it makes like no difference. You can change your underwear to suit the situation, but it is like a minimal difference. 
	<br>

	<br>
	All in all it is a sandbox game and the only way to play it is to run around and kill everyone with differnt wepons. You have a katana, mazes, guns and other tings. You can burn the bodies so that the police won't catch you. The only way to win is if you and your senpai are the only two people left at the school. Who can you senpai choose then? Senpai only has one choice. Senpai will notice me.
