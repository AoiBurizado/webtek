<h2>Review</h2>
<p>In Hatoful Boyfriend you play as a girl who has been accepted into a school for birds. It's the start of the semester and throughout the schoolyear you experience the typical troubles of a young school girl: academic pressure, friends and, of course, which bird to pursue for a romantic relationship.</p>

<p>Good morning, everybirdie! The class starts and you are introduced to Nanaki Kazuaki, a button quail who is going to be your teacher this year. You also meet Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a fantail pigeon, and Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove who is also your childhood friend. The game plays much like most dating simulators. You follow the story and every once in a while you're presented with a choice. These choices determine how the story will play out and finally, which bird you will end up with. There are some other mechanics, however. There is also a stats system. Wisdom, vitality and charisma can be leveled up at certain points in the game. Getting stats to a certain point will open up new dialog options and enable you to experience other parts of the game, but it is not very obvious exactly how this works. The game doesn't tell you exactly what each stat does and there is also no indication as to whether a certain option will give you a stat bonus or not.</p>

<p>The writing is very enjoyable. It is very silly and it likes to throw bird-puns at you such as "everybirde" and "nobirdie". The characters are the stereotypical anime characters - the best friend, the shy one, the popular one, the one who is always superior. Despite this, the game pushes these characters beyond their stereotypes and actually creates interesting stories.
Hatoful Boyfriend is a weird game, there is no doubt about that. But yet it manages to create interesting characters of birds and interesting stories in this silly world. Despite the unintuitive stats system the game delivered many funny moments.</p>
