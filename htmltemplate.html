<p>Do you want to date a japanese highschool girl? Want to get it on with your senpai? Or maybe you are more interested in that cute underclassman? Maybe even your own classmate? Then this game is something you probably will enjoy. The protagonist in this game (you) is a high school boy, and have just moved to a new town. Your days will consist of going to school, doing your part time job, exercising or practicing your hobbies. And of course try to get closer to the girl you like! There are three different potential girlfriends in this game: the sporty  and refined Manaka Takane (your classmate), the punky and lonesome Rinko Kobayakawa (underclassman) and the responsible big sister character Nene Anegasaki (upperclassman).</p>

<p>The gameplay in the first part of the game is choosing activities during the day, where the different girls will be part of different actions. For example doing lots of part-time will get you closer to the girl working part time. This part of the game can be pretty quick, since you do your activities, sleep and repeat. But after this phase and you, hopefully, have confessed to a girl it will switch to real time mode.</p>

<p>In real time mode your life dating a japanese highschool girl truly starts. Now the time in the game matches the time of your NDS, and this will play an important role in the game. The girl will want to go on dates, and these dates are decided between the two of you, and will be based on real time. This means that the game might become quite time consuming, especially since you will have to communicate with her at least every other game in order to keep a good relationship with her. You can also speak to her through a "chatting" function, where she will speak to you through primitive commands. By primitive I mean the fact that she cannot form too complex sentences, but the function is very cute and enjoyable. The game operating in real time also means that it follows the same day as you, and events like christmas and Valentines dates are possible. </p>

<p>This game gave me a fun time, especially since this is a very interactive dating sim and you get more of a "real" feeling. And it also potentially lasts forever, which is an unusual quality compared to other dating sims. The game following the seasons and the holidays makes the game a little dynamic, but after a few months I grew tired of always having to log in to meet her so often. But if you do not have much else to fill your days with, and wish to have a virtual girlfriend that is kind and willing to fulfill your wishes then this is definitely the game for you.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Love Plus + is a japanese dating sim for the Nintendo DS system, which officially currently only exists in the japanese language and for japanese systems. However, if you get yourself an NDS emulator or have a flash card for the NDS you can get a fan translated version in english and be able to play it without any problem.</p>
