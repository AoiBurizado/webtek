	<p>
	The final product of the design phase is a webpage that contains a structured essay - a combination of text and images of your mockup pages. The document (webpage) should contain these components:
	</p>
</section>


<section>
	<h4>
	1. Header:
	</h4>
	A title, the author names, and date. <br>
	Title: GeiMate <br>
	Authors: My Thao Nguyen, Iselin B. Erikssen, Dag Kirstihagen, Kristoffer Lervik and Marius Enerly. <br>
	Date: 30.09.2015 (exampledate)<br>

	<h4>
	2. Administrative Details:
	</h4>
	<p>
	The name of your client, and his or her position in the organization. <br>
	Lars Henrik Grytten <br>
	Lars Henrik Grytten is the managing director of GeiMate.<br>

		3. Purpose, goals, and audience:
	</h4>
	<strong>
		Purpose
	</strong>
	<p>
		The purpose of the site is to give in-dept reviews about dating simulators. Our goal is to make someone consider playing a game we give a great review, and to spread the word about dating simulators and how they can change your life.
	</p>
	<strong>
		Audience 
	</strong>
	<p>
		We believe that our main audience will be people who enjoy dating simulators. We believe that what they need is a rankingsite of different dating simulators so that they can make better choices about what games they use their time to. Some might have really specific preferences and it is a good idea to check out the reviews before you spend your money on something you ended up disliking. 
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>
		4. Navigation Structure:
	</h4>
	<p>
		A brief discussion about the site's navigation structure using the terminology learned in class and the notes on navigation structures. This is not a sketch of your navbar (or whatever), but instead a map or description of which pages connect to which other pages. (It sometimes better to describe a clique in words than to try to draw it.) The goal is to explain why the choice of a particular structure makes sense for your website.<br>
		The main page will have a list of the most recent reviews and a navigation bar on the top so that users can easily navigate to the type of game they are interested in. When the user clicks on one of the categories, they are navigated to a page with all the reviews of that category, sorted by date.

	5. Page Layout and Appearance:
	</h4>
	<p>
	A description of design decisions that are universal to your site. You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes), the color scheme (for text, background, links, shadows, borders, etc.), navbar position in the page and its appearance, banner, footer, the social icons bar, or background images (if any of them is applicable). In addition to the textual description of these elements, you should include a mockup image of this generic page that has only these common elements and no other content. <br>
	Finally, you should describe how these universal design decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and its audience. 
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Underneath we have listed our universal design decisions that include:</dt>
			<dd>- fonts(types and sizes)</dd>
			<dd>- Color scheme( text, background, links, shadows, borders etc.)</dd>
			<dd>- Navbar position and appearance</dd>
	</dl>

	<strong>
		Template:
	</strong>
	<p>
		Page will be centered horizontally with 30% margin on each side. 
		The top of the page will feature a logo with a slogan for the site (unknown dimensions).
		We will place the contentsection with a bit of padding or margin, depending on how it actually will look as a website. Since this is just a mockup it might change later, but for now we will have a 20px padding/margin.
		Below that is a navigation bar with links to the  following pages:

	<strong>
	Images and thumbnails	
	</strong>
	<p>
		Thumbnails will be used for our “newest/latest reviews”-section and their dimensions will depend on the content section. We will test it out when we start designing the universal html-template. They have to be small enough to fit next to the small teaser-text-review, but big enough to show the audience what the game is going to be like.<br>
		Images in the reviews will be as big as the section allows to show the audience better detail of the game. These dimensions we will also decide later after setting up the html-template.
	</p>

	<strong>
		Brief discussion
	</strong>
	<p>
		As we are aware of that the name of our site may be mistaken for something else than a romance gaming review site, we chose a slogan to “correct” this misunderstanding with “Our reviews, your match”. With this slogan, where we specifically mention “Reviews” we believe it will be almost impossible for you to misunderstand after reading it. This logo and slogan will be on every page of our GeiMate site. <br>
		When you press “Categories” you won’t be directed to a new website, unless you press either “Dating Sim”, “RPG” or Visual Novel. Compared to “About us” however, if you press “About us” you will be directed to “Contact Information” as a default. <br>
		We have chosen rose, pink colors for the navigation bar to support our theme of a romance gaming review site. Since the navigation bar background is pink, we chose a white text color, as a black text color would seem too harsh.<br>
		We figured having “shadow” to the content background would make it pop a lot more and separate it from the grey background. This fulfills our goal of making the subtle, pink content background more eye-catching. <br>
		Links of the site, will have the same basic colors as the navigation bar, with a rose-pink color. There will also be a difference in the hovering. This is so that we can keep our “romantic” theme, but also so that the design corresponds with what a simple user would expect from links. <br>
		Content text is a subtle grey, instead of a harsh black, which we believe would be very contradicting with our pink and subtle theme. <br>
		We will have titles in the content section a bit darker grey (but still grey and not black) and a bit bigger than the normal paragraph size to separate them. <br>
		We believe our universal design decisions fulfill our goals of a “romance”-theme gaming review site and audience. <br>

	<h4>
		6. Content:
	</h4>
	<p>
		This is the longest section of your document. For every page, you will need to give a text description of the content of the page as well as an image of the mockup of the page. The text describes what goal(s) this page fulfills, and how design decisions specific to it contribute into fulfilling such goals. The reason why you should describe the content is that you might not have yet received the actual content from the client and in your mockup of the page you will be using fake text, fake images, etc. While the content can be fake, you should try to use meaningful headings and captions to convey its meaning. Finally you should describe the design decisions that are unique for this particular page (if any). Here is an example: Images of e-board members are stored as thumbnails to reduce the loading time of the page. They appear in a grid format on the left side of the page. Each thumbnail is of size 150x150. When clicked, they will open as larger images (320x480) on the right side of the page, surrounded by text describing the member's duties and reasons for joining the org. The chosen thumbnail will have a surrounding border in gray color, to provide visual feedback to the user for the selected content
	</p>
	<p>	
		<img src="../Images/home.png" alt="Homepage">
	<p>
	<strong>Unique pages:<br>
	Homepage</strong>
	<p>
		When you visit the website, you will be directed to the homepage. The top section of the page will contain the logo of the company, with the text: “Our reviews, your match”. Thereafter the navigation bar for homepage, categories, about us and a search bar. This will be similar for every webpage on our website. The homepage will in addition include the five newest reviews, with a picture and an ingress related to the game.<br>
		 
		The goal for the homepage is to attract the user to GeiMate. To catch their attention, the user will get a sneak peek at the latest reviews, which will be presented with a picture and an ingress for the specific game. This will provide the user with a general idea of the content, which will encourage to explore the website further.<br>

		Through the use of JavaScript, we will provide a search bar in the navigation bar, drop down menus in the navigation bar, the screen will bounce when you scroll all the way to the top, the text of the logo will change to Japanese when you mouse over the logo, when u scroll down the page,  the logo will disappear, while the navigation bar will follow the screen and when images are clicked, you will get a full screen view of the image. These will be the equal for every webpage on the website.  Specific for the homepage and the review category pages, there will only be shown the five latest reviews, and there will be an arrow to navigate to older reviews. <br>

		When you click on categories, the drop down menu will be as shown on the second mockup. You will then have to click one of the categories in order to get directed further to a new page. The search bar will function as shown on the third mockup. As you hover over the logo, the text will change to Japanese as shown below <br>

	<strong>
	Review category (“Dating Simulation”, “RPG” and “Visual Novel”)
	</strong>
	<p>
		The review category page, which is either dating simulation, rpg or visual novel index page, will contain the newest reviews for the specific category. It will, in similarity to the sneak peeks on the homepage, be composed of a picture and an ingress related to the game. If there are more than five reviews in the same category, it will be possible to navigate to older reviews similar as on the homepage.<br>
		The main goal with the website is to make the user consider playing a game, through our reviews. In order to achieve this goal, the review category page will provide a sneak peek on our latest reviews, specific to the category the user have selected. This will make for a greater chance to find a game that will be of interest for the user.<br>
		The use of JavaScript will be as described in Homepage
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="../Images/ReviewIndex.png" alt="Review index">
	</p>
	<strong>
	Review
	</strong>
	<p>
		The review pages will consist of the actual game reviews. Each review got a title, an ingress, a brunt and a conclusion, in addition to at least one image. <br>
		The goal of the review pages will be to the user interested enough to try out the reviewed games. In order to achieve this goal, the review pages will contain appealing writing and relevant use of images.<br> 
		The use of JavaScript will be as described in Homepage. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="../Images/Review.png" alt="Review">
	</p>
	<strong>
	Contact information
	</strong>
	<p>
		When you click on “About us” in the navigation bar, you will be directed to the contact information page, which will contain a short description of the company, in addition to the contact information. The contact information consists of the owner’s name, Lars Henrik Grytten, his phone number, 12345678 and the company’s address, Høgskoleringen 3, 7030 Trondheim.  The look of the page will be similar to the review category pages, except that the “About us” in the navigation bar will have lighter color to indicate that you are currently on this page, in addition to that the page will not contain pictures. <br>
		The goal of this section is to inform the user about the company, in addition to provide the contact information so that the user have the possibility to contact the company<br>
		The use of JavaScript will be as described in Homepage.

	<h4>
	7. Minimum Requirements:
	</h4>
	<p>
	The website must include four distinct JavaScript applications (for example, rollovers effects on images or menus, user-defined functions, form validation, animations etc.). The four applications must all be different from each other. <strong>Clearly indicate how each of you will be fulfilling these minimum requirements.</strong> Please note that each of these items must be constructed entirely by you and not copied from external websites on the Web (though you can modify code from our class materials). Once you fulfill the minimum requirements with your own code, you are allowed to get code from the web (with source attribution) to incorporate certain advanced components (e.g. image galleries with transitions), but they will not count as part of the minimum requirements.

	<h4>
	8. Plan: 
	</h4>
	<p>
	Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline the tasks to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them. Include a list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include a complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by the time your design is done, so that nothing will delay your coding.
