	Our client, Lars Henrik, wanted a unique gaming review site. Together we came to an agreement on focusing our site specifically on dating games The company is named GeiMate and Lars is the managing director of the company. This implies among others that he is the leader and has the last word on major decisions.

	<h4>
		Changes that we have made
	</h4>
	<p>
	We had initially planned to have 11 pages, but because we wanted to have two reviews for each category (dating sim, rpg and visual novel) we ended up with 12. There are a few stylistic and structural changes, and these changes are summarized below. Not all files were changed from the original design. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Changes to index.html:</b> we changed the location of the search/filterbar. We added arrows and numbers to be able to change pages if there are too many on the first one. All reviews are shown on the index.html. We also made the thumbnails linked to the specific review, instead of having the thumbnail pop up as first intended.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Changes to aboutus.html:</b> We added information about how to activate the konamicode. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Changes to dating_sim.html, rpg.html and visual_novel.html:</b> Searchbar style, location and name was changed. Arrows for scalable review category has been added to dating_sim.html through search.js. We made the thumbnails linked to the specific review, instead of having the thumbnail pop up as first intended.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Changes to search.js and navbar.js:</b> Among other things we changed the searchbar’s shape and location. Instead of placing it with the navigation bar, we decided to move it on the pages title’s right side. This is because it was unclear that the search bar could only be used on some pages. Some users expected the searchbar to be able to search the whole website for reviews. In reality, it only filters the reviews on the current page. Therefore we only have the search/filter bar available on the pages with a lot of review to choose from. In addition to the location and design changes, we also switched the name to “filter”. Javascript for the pagenavigationarrows are within the search.js and changes page if the amount of reviews on the page is too high. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Other than these changes, we didn't do much that we had not already planned. Mostly we knew what we wanted to make and design, and just coded it. 
	<br>
	<br>	
	<b>Universal changes to reviews:</b> All of the pictures in each review has now a “pictureText” to go with. Also, we changed the the reviews after making them to have the same universal design. Picture at the top, a small introduction followed by general game information. Some of the reviews has a game trailer.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Changes to webstyle.css:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Originally the website was supposed to have a shadow on both sides of the “content”, however after some time we found it to make the site look more flat than having the shadow on only one side. Therefore the final product has a classical shadow, where the right side has a clear shadow, and the bottom has a shadow slightly shaded towards the left.
			</li>
			<li>
				The content body is slimmer than originally planned, and not scaled on percentage but rather a set width in pixels (750px).
			</li>
			<li>
				A footer was not supposed to be on the site, and the content background would stretch all the way down on the website without any padding at the bottom. However we found a footer to be useful, and made the site look better and a bit more open and free when not stretched all the way down. Therefore the content background css height was changed considerably, only being as long as there is content.
			</li>
			<li>
				The filter/search area was moved from the navigation bar completely and rather placed on the relevant pages. Thus the buttons on the navbar got a bit wider than planned.
			</li>
			<li>
				Drop down in the nav bar was supposed to have a background with 40% opacity, but it looked a bit strange and we settled with a solid coloured background instead.
			</li>
			<li>
				To begin with we had a few different font styles planned for the site, but we went for a more uniform look and stuck to only one main font and one backup font.
			</li>
			<li>
				We slightly changed the size and colour of the different text areas for better general readability and looks.
			</li>
			<li>
				The nav bar and search/filter field were originally thought to be square, though we found a more rounded design to be kinder to the eye. Therefore the nav bar is slightly rounded on the edges, while search/filter field is in an almost oval shape.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		<b>konamicode.js added:</b>
		To honor the creators of the website we were allowed to make a konami code that will make five sprites, one for each member, run across the screen along the bottom of the browser window. To access it we made it traditional konami code like; up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A.
